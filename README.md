# COVID-movement

How has COVID affected movement throughout Chicago? What modes of transport (air, rideshare, public transit, bicycle) were preferable compared to others? Could we predict how these transport methods will change post-pandemic?

1. How has each main transport method changed between 2019 and 2020? Has any one increased? Decreased?
2. How do the different transport methods compare?
3. What other axes (trip times, average tips/money spent) can be compared?
